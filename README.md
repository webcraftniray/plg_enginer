# plg_enginer

This plugin will change the engine on all MySQL tables to the selected engine in Params.

Please set the plugin, then check tables, then disable the plugin once the desired table engine is set. This is becuase the queries will fire on each page load and will slow your site.

The plugin is only for those who require their tables engines to be changed. It's not an otherwise useful Joomla plugin.
